//! # Dychess â€” (hopefully) fast chess library for chess engines
//! This crate was created to potentially make my chess engine Dysprosium faster by using a much
//! better chess library that is optimized for better chess engine performance instead of the
//! generic `chess` crate, and opening up the possibility of playing Fischer Random Chess as well.
