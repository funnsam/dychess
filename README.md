# Dychess â€” (hopefully) fast chess library for chess engines
This crate was created to potentially make my chess engine Dysprosium faster by using a much better
chess library that is optimized for better chess engine performance instead of the generic `chess`
crate, and opening up the possibility of playing Fischer Random Chess as well.
